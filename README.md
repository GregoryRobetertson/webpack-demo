# webpack-demo

This is a basic project demonstrating the setup of webpack for bundling JavaScript modules and handling CSS files.

## Project Description

The project consists of a simple web application that updates the text content of an HTML element using JavaScript. Initially, the text is set to "Initial Text", and it is later updated to "Hello, World!" using JavaScript. Additionally, the Lodash library is used to convert the string "hello world" to camel case.
